prompt:
can you redo the conversion to codon compatablility now that we have correctly accessed the pyton libraries using matplotlib: followed by dbg.py file, also previosly was provided with the information on how to convert classes to codon compatable classes

output:
Here's the properly converted Codon-compatible version with matplotlib support: followed by the code in dbg_codon.py


prompt:
Now write a script that will:
Run Python code automatically.
Run Codon code automatically (use codon run -release for timing).
Programmatically compile the results and runtimes.
The output of the script should look like:

Dataset	Language 	Runtime 	N50
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
data1	python		0:20:00		9118
data1	codon		0:10:00		9118
...

add set -euxo pipefail to the beginning of the test script to ensure that the script terminates immediately if something goes wrong. This will save you a significant amount of debugging time.

output: earlier version of evaluate.sh, then told to remove print statments before the final table, then after confirming the file ran removed x from set -euxo pipefail resulting in the finished script.
